Humans,Factual,"**Option I. All humans study.**
This option cannot be concluded from the given information. The first fact only states that all students are humans, but it does not imply that all humans are students. The third fact states that educated humans study, but it does not specify that all humans are educated.

**Option II. Those in college are humans.**
This option is true. The first fact states that all students are humans, and the second fact states that some students are in college. Therefore, it logically follows that those in college are humans.

**Option III. Some students are not in college.**
This option is true. The second fact explicitly states that some students are in college, which implies that there are some students who are not in college."
Humans,Factual,"I. False
II. True
III. True"
Humans,Factual,"Option I. All humans study is not true because Fact 3 only specifies that *educated* humans study and does not mention anything about all humans studying.
Option II. Those in college are humans is true because Fact 1 states that all students are humans, and Fact 2 states that some students are in college.
Option III. Some students are not in college is true because Fact 2 implies that some students are not in college."
Humans,Factual,"1. Option I. All humans study. 
   - This statement is not necessarily true based on the provided facts. While we know that all students are humans (Fact 1) and that educated humans study (Fact 3), we cannot conclude that all humans study. There may be humans who are not students and therefore do not study.

2. Option II. Those in college are humans.
   - This statement is true based on the provided facts. Fact 1 states that all students are humans, and Fact 2 states that some students are in college. Therefore, it logically follows that those in college must also be humans.

3. Option III. Some students are not in college. 
   - This statement is true based on the provided facts. While Fact 2 states that some students are in college, it does not exclude the possibility of other students not being in college. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that some students are in college, while others are not."
Humans,Factual,"Option I. All humans study. (True)
Option II. Those in college are humans. (True)
Option III. Some students are not in college. (True)"
Humans,Factual,Option II: Those in college are humans.
Humans,Factual,"Option I. All humans do not necessarily study. Hence, Option I is not true.
Option II. Those in college are necessarily humans. Hence, Option II is true.
Option III. Some students may not be in college. Hence, Option III is true."
Humans,Factual,"Option I. All humans study. This option is false because the given statements do not provide any information about humans who are not students.

Option II. Those in college are humans. This option is true because it can be derived from Fact 1: All students are humans.

Option III. Some students are not in college. This option is true because it can be derived from Fact 2: Some students are in college."
Humans,Factual,Option II. Those in college are humans.
Humans,Factual,"Option I. All humans study. - This is false. The third fact states that ""Educated humans study."" This means that not all humans study. Only educated humans study.

Option II. Those in college are humans. - This is true. The first fact states that ""All students are humans."" The second fact states that ""Some students are in college."" Therefore, those in college must be humans.

Option III. Some students are not in college. - This is true. The second fact states that ""Some students are in college."" This means that there must be some students who are not in college."
Humans,Factual,Option II. Those in college are humans.
Humans,Factual,"**Option I. All humans study.**

This option cannot be inferred from the given facts. While it is true that all students are humans and all educated humans study, the given facts do not provide any information about whether all humans are educated. Therefore, we cannot conclude that all humans study.

**Option II. Those in college are humans.**

This option is true. Fact 2 states that some students are in college, and Fact 1 states that all students are humans. Therefore, we can conclude that those in college are humans.

**Option III. Some students are not in college.**

This option is also true. Fact 2 states that some students are in college, which implies that there must be some students who are not in college. Therefore, we can conclude that some students are not in college."
Humans,Factual,Option II. Those in college are humans.
Humans,Factual,"I. All humans study. 
    This is not a valid conclusion because the provided facts do not mention anything about all humans studying.

Humans,Factual,"- Option I is false because according to Fact 1, all students are humans, and according to Fact 3, educated humans study, so not all humans study.
- Option II is true because Fact 1 states that all students are humans, and Fact 2 states that some students are in college, so those in college must be humans.
- Option III is true because Fact 2 states that some students are in college, which implies that some students are not in college."
Humans,Factual,"**Option I. All humans study.**
