Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"Option I is false because the statement says that small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared, not all rectangles.
Option II is true because fact 2 states that some squares are unit-squares and fact 1 states that all squares are rectangles.
Option III is true because fact 3 states that some squares are unit-squares, which implies that there are squares that are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option I. All rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. - False
Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles. - True
Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares. - True"
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and III are true.

Option II is true because Fact 1 states that all squares are rectangles, and Fact 2 states that some squares are unit-squares. This means that unit-squares are a type of rectangle.

Option III is true because Fact 2 states that some squares are unit-squares. This means that there must be other squares that are not unit-squares.

Option I is not true because Fact 3 only states that small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared, but it does not say that all rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared."
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"I. False. Not all rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. 
II. True. Unit-squares are squares and all squares are rectangles. 
III. True. Not all squares are unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true. 

Option II: Unit-squares are rectangles. 
A square is a rectangle with equal sides. A unit-square is a square with a side length of 1 unit. Therefore, unit-squares are rectangles.

Option III: Some squares are not unit-squares. 
This is true because there are squares with side lengths other than 1 unit. For example, a square with a side length of 2 units is a square but not a unit-square.

Option I is false because not all rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. For example, a rectangle with a length of 2 units and a width of 3 units has an area of 6 unit squared."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and III are true.

Option I is false since there are rectangles that have an area greater than 1 unit squared.

Option II is true since all squares are rectangles, and unit-squares are squares.

Option III is true since not all squares are unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option I: All rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared.
This option is false because there are rectangles with areas greater than 1 unit squared. For example, a rectangle with sides of length 2 and 3 has an area of 6 unit squared.

Option II: Unit-squares are rectangles.
This option is true because a unit-square is a square with a side length of 1 unit. All squares are rectangles, so a unit-square is a rectangle.

Option III: Some squares are not unit-squares.
This option is true because there are squares with side lengths greater than 1 unit. For example, a square with a side length of 2 units is not a unit-square."
Shapes,Factual,"**Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.**

Fact 1 tells us that all squares are also rectangles. Fact 2 tells us that some squares are unit-squares. Therefore, based on deductive reasoning, some unit-squares are also rectangles."
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"Option II is true.
Option III is true."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

Since all squares are rectangles, and some squares are unit-squares, it follows that unit-squares are rectangles. This makes Option II true.

Also, since some squares are unit-squares, and small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared, it follows that some squares are not unit-squares. This makes Option III true.

Option I is not true, because there are rectangles that are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

* **Option I is false**. The third factual statement only says that ""small rectangles"" have an area of 1 unit squared, not all rectangles.
* **Option II is true**. The first factual statement says that all squares are rectangles, and the second factual statement says that some squares are unit-squares. So, some unit-squares are rectangles.
* **Option III is true**. The second factual statement says that some squares are unit-squares. So, there must be some squares that are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

From Fact 1, we know that all squares are rectangles. From Fact 2, we know that some squares are unit-squares. Therefore, we can conclude that unit-squares are rectangles (Option II).

From Fact 2 and Fact 3, we know that some squares are unit-squares and small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. Therefore, we can conclude that some squares are not unit-squares (Option III).

Option I is not true because we cannot conclude from the given facts that all rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared."

Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles. Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares.
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

Since all squares are rectangles, and some squares are unit-squares, it follows that unit-squares are rectangles. Additionally, since all squares are rectangles, but some squares are not unit-squares, it follows that some squares are not unit-squares.

Option I is not true because the statement ""Small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared"" does not imply that all rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

From Fact 1, we know that all squares are rectangles. From Fact 2, we know that some squares are unit-squares. So Option II is true.

From Fact 3, we know that small rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. Since unit-squares are rectangles, and they have an area of 1 unit squared, some squares are not unit-squares. So Option III is true.

Option I is false because not all rectangles are unit-squares."

and
Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares."
Shapes,Factual,    Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"Option I. All rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared:
- This statement is false because there are rectangles that do not have an area of 1 unit squared. For example, a rectangle with a length of 2 units and a width of 3 units has an area of 6 unit squared.

Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles:
- This statement is true because a unit-square is a square with a side length of 1 unit, and all squares are rectangles.

Option III. Some squares are not unit-squares:
- This statement is true because there are squares that do not have a side length of 1 unit. For example, a square with a side length of 2 units is not a unit-square.

Therefore, only options II and III are true."
Shapes,Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

Shapes,Factual,Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles.
Shapes,Factual,"Option I. All rectangles have an area of 1 unit squared. This is not true, as rectangles can have any area.
Option II. Unit-squares are rectangles. This is true, as a unit-square is a square with an area of 1 unit squared, which is a type of rectangle.
