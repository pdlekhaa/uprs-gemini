Type,Fact,Response
Humans,Non-Factual,"**Option I. All humans study.**

This option is not true because Fact 3 states that non-educated humans study, which implies that some humans do not study.

**Option II. Students are humans.**

This option is true because Fact 2 states that some in college are students, and Fact 1 states that all in college are humans.

**Option III. Some in college are not students.**

This option is true because Fact 2 states that some in college are students, which implies that there are some in college who are not students.

Therefore, the correct answers are: **Option II. Students are humans.** and **Option III. Some in college are not students.**"
Humans,Non-Factual,"Option II is true because it is a direct inference from Fact 1.
Option III is true because it is a logical inference from Fact 2.
Option I is false because Fact 3 only states that non-educated humans study, not all humans."
Humans,Non-Factual,"Option I. All humans study. - False
Option II. Students are humans. - True
Option III. Some in college are not students. - True"
Humans,Non-Factual,"Option II and Option III are true.

* Option I. All humans study. 
From Fact 1, we know that all in college are humans. 
From Fact 3, we know that non-educated humans study. 
Since all in college are humans, we can infer that all non-educated humans in college study. However, we do not know if educated humans study, so Option I is not true.

* Option II. Students are humans. 
From Fact 2, we know that some in college are students. 
From Fact 1, we know that all in college are humans. 
So we can infer that some in college who are students are humans. 
Therefore, Option II is true.

* Option III. Some in college are not students. 
From Fact 1, we know that all in college are humans. 
From Fact 2, we know that some in college are students. 
Therefore, we can infer that some in college are not students. 
So Option III is true."

Humans,Non-Factual,"**Option I. All humans study.**
Fact 1 states that all in college are humans. Fact 3 states that non-educated humans study. Therefore, all humans study. Option I is true.

**Option II. Students are humans.**
Fact 2 states that some in college are students. Fact 1 states that all in college are humans. Therefore, students are humans. Option II is true.

**Option III. Some in college are not students.**
Fact 2 states that some in college are students. This implies that some in college are not students. Option III is true.

Therefore, all three options are true."
Humans,Non-Factual,"Option I. All humans study. 

This option cannot be true because Fact 3 states that ""non-educated humans study,"" but Fact 1 states that ""all in college are humans,"" and Fact 2 states that ""some in college are students."" So some humans in college are not non-educated, and therefore, it cannot be true that all humans study.

Option II. Students are humans. 

This option is true because Fact 2 states that ""some in college are students,"" and Fact 1 states that ""all in college are humans."" Therefore, it can be concluded that students are humans.

Option III. Some in college are not students. 

This option is true because Fact 2 states that ""some in college are students,"" which implies that there are others in college who are not students."

Humans,Non-Factual,"- Option I is false. While it is true that all college students are humans, we cannot infer from the given statements that all humans study. 
- Option II is true. The first fact implicitly states that all humans are college students, and the second fact explicitly states that some college students are students. Therefore, we can conclude that students are humans. 
- Option III is true. The second fact states that some in college are students. This means that there must be others in college who are not students."

Humans,Non-Factual,"- Option I: All humans study. This option is not true because it cannot be inferred from the given facts. Fact 3 only mentions that non-educated humans study.

- Option II: Students are humans. This option is true because it is a restatement of Fact 2.

**Option II. Students are humans.**

This option is **correct**. Fact 1 states that all in college are humans, and Fact 2 states that some in college are students. Therefore, students are humans.

**Option III. Some in college are not students.**

This option is **correct**. Fact 2 states that some in college are students. Therefore, there must be some in college who are not students.
