Chickens,Factual,"From the given statements, we can conclude that:

1. Option I is true. Fact 3 states that female birds lay eggs, and Fact 1 states that all chickens are birds. Therefore, all chickens are female birds and lay eggs.

2. Option II is true. Fact 2 explicitly states that some chickens are hens.

3. Option III is true. Fact 2 states that some chickens are hens, which implies that there are also chickens that are not hens.

Chickens,Factual,Option II. Hens are birds.
Chickens,Factual,"From Fact 1, we know that all chickens are birds. From Fact 2, we know that some chickens are hens. Therefore, hens are birds (Option II is true). From Fact 3, we know that female birds lay eggs. Since hens are female birds (because they are chickens, which are birds), hens lay eggs.
