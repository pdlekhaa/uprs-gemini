Chickens,Non-Factual,"- Option I. All birds lay eggs. (False)
- Option II. Chickens are birds. (True)
- Option III. Some hens are not chickens. (True)"
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I: All birds lay eggs. 

    Fact 3 states that ""Male birds lay eggs."" However, hens are female birds (Fact 1) and female birds lay eggs. Therefore, it is false to say that all birds lay eggs. Option I is false.

Option II: Chickens are birds. 

    Fact 2 clearly implies that chickens are hens. Fact 1 states that all hens are birds. Therefore, it is true to say that chickens are birds. Option II is true.

Option III: Some hens are not chickens. 

    Fact 2 implies that some hens are chickens. Therefore, it is false to say that some hens are not chickens. Option III is false.

    In conclusion, the correct options are II. Chickens are birds."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I is false because fact 3 states that male birds lay eggs, so not all birds lay eggs.
Option II is true because chickens are a type of bird (fact 2).
Option III is true because fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, so there must be some hens that are not chickens.

Therefore, the true options are:

Option II. Chickens are birds.
Option III. Some hens are not chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs. **False**. Fact 3 states that male birds lay eggs, which contradicts the statement that all birds lay eggs.

Option II. Chickens are birds. **True.** Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, and Fact 1 states that all hens are birds. Therefore, by transitive property, chickens are birds.

Option III. Some hens are not chickens. **True.** Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which implies that some hens are not chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"**Option I is false**. Statement 3 indicates that male birds lay eggs, which contradicts the claim that all birds lay eggs.

**Option II is true**. Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which implies that chickens are a subset of birds.

**Option III is true**. Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which means that not all hens are chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds is true.
Chickens,Non-Factual,"- Option I. All birds lay eggs. This statement is false because of Fact 3, which states that male birds lay eggs. Therefore, not all birds lay eggs.
- Option II. Chickens are birds. This statement is true because Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, and Fact 1 states that all hens are birds. Therefore, chickens must also be birds.
- Option III. Some hens are not chickens. This statement is true because Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which implies that there must be other hens that are not chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds.
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I and II are true.

Fact 1 states that all hens are birds. Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens. So we can conclude that chickens are birds. Fact 3 states that male birds lay eggs. This statement does not contradict the first two statements. So we can conclude that all birds lay eggs.

Fact 3 does not provide any information about whether some hens are not chickens. So we cannot conclude that some hens are not chickens. Therefore, Option III is false."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"- Option I is False. Not all birds lay eggs. For example, male birds do not lay eggs.
- Option II is True. Chickens are birds because all hens are birds and some hens are chickens.
- Option III is True. Some hens are not chickens because Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which means that there must be some hens that are not chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs. - False
Option II. Chickens are birds. - True
Option III. Some hens are not chickens. - True"
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I is false because Fact 3 states that male birds lay eggs, which contradicts the statement that all birds lay eggs.
Option II is true because Fact 1 states that all hens are birds, and Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which implies that chickens are birds.
Option III is true because Fact 2 states that some hens are chickens, which implies that there are also hens that are not chickens.

Therefore, the correct options are II and III."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs - Incorrect (Fact 3 indicates that male birds lay eggs, but not all birds are male).
Option II. Chickens are birds - Correct (Fact 2 indicates that chickens are a type of hen, and hens are birds).

Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds.
Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds.
Chickens,Non-Factual,None of the options are true.
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs. Is false, because it is given that ""Male birds lay eggs"". Therefore, not all birds lay eggs.

Option II. Chickens are birds. Is true, because it is given that ""Some hens are chickens"" and it is also given that ""All hens are birds"". 

Option III. Some hens are not chickens. Is also true because it is given that ""All hens are birds"" and ""Some hens are chickens"", then it is logical to assume that there are hens that are not chickens."
Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds.
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs is false because the third statement states that ""Male birds lay eggs"" which is not true for all birds.

Option II. Chickens are birds is true because the second statement states that ""Some hens are chickens"" and the first statement states that ""All hens are birds"".

Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds.
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs. - **False** (Fact 3 contradicts this statement)
Option II. Chickens are birds. - **True** (Fact 2 implies this statement)
Option III. Some hens are not chickens. - **True** (Fact 2 implies this statement)"
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I. All birds lay eggs - False, because only female birds lay eggs, and males do not.
Option II. Chickens are birds - True 
Option III. Some hens are not chickens - True"
Chickens,Non-Factual,Option II. Chickens are birds
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Option I is false because Fact 3 states that male birds lay eggs, which means not all birds lay eggs.

Therefore, the correct answer is: Option II and Option III."
Chickens,Non-Factual,"Based on the given statements:

1. All hens are birds: This means that all hens belong to the category of birds.
2. Some hens are chickens: This implies that not all hens are chickens, but some of them are.
3. Male birds lay eggs: This statement is incorrect as male birds do not typically lay eggs. Only female birds lay eggs.

Considering the corrected version of Fact 3: ""Female birds lay eggs,"" the following options can be determined:

**Option I. All birds lay eggs:** This option is not necessarily true based on the given statements. While it is mentioned that female birds lay eggs, there is no information about male birds or all birds laying eggs.

**Option II. Chickens are birds:** This option is true. Fact 1 states that ""All hens are birds,"" and Fact 2 states that ""Some hens are chickens."" Therefore, by implication, some chickens are birds.

**Option III. Some hens are not chickens:** This option is also true. Fact 2 mentions that ""Some hens are chickens."" This implies that there are hens that are not chickens.
